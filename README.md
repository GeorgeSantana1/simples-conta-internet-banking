## ❓ About
- A simple react app that simulates a internet banking application with account statement overview.
- The simples conta internet banking project was made for a developer test with the following requirements:
1. Create <strong>Login screen</strong> for an Internet Banking
2. Create the <strong>Internet Banking</strong> Home of the Simple Account (company data, balance, graph of entry and exit) 
3. Create <strong>company statement</strong> and statement detail
4. Allow <strong>filtering</strong> by transaction type and <strong>"Credit"</strong> and <strong>"Debit"</strong> flag
5. Create a screen to show transactions grouped by card, present finalCard and value

## 📦 What's inside the box?
- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## 👩‍💻 How to play
- Clone the repo with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joaopaulo-ld/simples-conta-internet-banking
```
- Install the dependecies with `yarn` or `npm i`
- Run the project with `yarn start` or `npm start`
- Start hacking on `localhost:3000`

## 👀 To implement
- [ ] Improve the main input and output chart
- [ ] Implement the shimmer effect on the components that needs to load data from mock files
- [ ] Implement cryptography on localStorage items
- [ ] Cards page (you can see a "maintenance" message on the page). the problem encountered was the possibility to filter the cards within the mocked data since the transactions are not grouped by company. But soon this feature will be finished.
- [ ] Register page. The register functionality is not yet implemented due to the mock data being static.
